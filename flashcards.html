            {unit: 8, q: "What is a central message of section 76?", a: "Everyone is going to heaven, not the same degree but still heaven. Resolves the dichotomy of Heaven and Hell - allows both love and justice to coexist. Shows degrees of heaven rather than the 'one-or-the-other' frame of mind.", source: "notion"},
            {unit: 8, q: "What are the general descriptions of who enters the celestial, terrestrial, telestial degrees of heaven, and outer darkness?", a: "<strong>Celestial Kingdom:</strong> Those who kept commandments, made covenants, and just men made perfect through Jesus's atonement<br><br><strong>Terrestrial Kingdom:</strong> Those who refuse to obey the gospel covenant and choose to be deceived by craftiness, but are otherwise good and honorable<br><br><strong>Telestial Kingdom:</strong> Murderers, whoremongers, and others who commit serious sins; they will pay for their sins until the end of atonement<br><br><strong>Outer Darkness:</strong> Those who have perfect knowledge of both the Father and Son but then try to dethrone and almost recrucify Christ", source: "notion"},

            {unit: 8, q: "How do we grow from grace to grace so we can also receive a fulness?", a: "1. Understanding what and how we worship - worship Christ and grow grace for grace to become like God<br>2. Keeping His commandments → approach the Father in Christ's name → become glorified in Christ<br>3. Jesus grew grace for grace and did not receive fullness at first<br>4. We progress as Jesus did and grow to a measure of the stature of the Father", source: "notion"},

It's the real eternal part of humanity that was not created. Intelligence combined with spirit constitutes a spiritual identity.<br><br>Spirit and matter/element are both eternal. All spirit is matter, but more fine or pure (D&C 131:7-8).", source: "web"},
